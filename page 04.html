<h3><mark><u>Bio-geochemical Cycle</u></mark></h3>
<p>life on Earth, growth and life processes in living organisms need some essential elements (40 elements), among them, six (06) are required in large quantity i.e. Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Sulphur and Phosphorous. These elements are taken up by the environment by the producers and made a part of protoplasm and finally given back to environment. These cycle continously goes through organisms and environment. And these cycles are called Bio-geochemical Cycle. <br> Some chemical cycles are:</p>
<ul>
<li><h4><u>Carbon-Oxygen Cycle:</u></h4> <p>In simple words, plants take CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere and gives O<sub>2</sub> back to the environment and utilize 'C' in making carbohydrates. This carbohydrates then passes from plants to other organisms through food chain. When organisms died, the amount of carbon is broken down by the micro-organisms and returned back to soil and environment by combustion of wood or coal. Also human beings respire O<sub>2</sub> and gives CO<sub>2</sub> back to environment. So, in this way, the amount of carbon is maintained and balanced in the environment. </p></li>
<li><h4><u>Nitrogen Cycle:</u></h4> <p>There are three steps in which nitrogen cycle occurs.</p> 
<ol type='i'>
<li><h5>Nitrogen Fixation:</h5> <p>It is the process of converting free atmospheric nitrogen gas into nitrates for the use of plants. The function is performed by bacteria is called "nitrogen fixing bacteria". </p></li>
<li><h5>Nitrification:</h5> <p>It is the process of converting nitrogenous compounds of living organisms into nitrates. It is performed by micro-organisms living in soil.</p></li>
