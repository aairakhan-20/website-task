<dt><h2><u>Introduction:</u></h2></dt>
<dd>Human beings and every specie is living on the planet <b>Earth</b>. No living organism lives in isolation. for their survival, they required a supply of energy and and some essential life sustaining elements which most necessary for the existance on Earth. They are surrounded by materials and energy which constitute its environment and from where it must derive it's needs. A supply of energy, nutrients and materials and the removal of waste products is also required.</dd>
<dt><h2><u>Concept of Biotic and Abiotic factors of environment:</u></h2>
<dd><b><i>Living Organisms</i></b> are those organisms which are living in nature. That can reproduce, grow and develop by their own and require energy in any form for this purpose. They produce their offsprings and maintain their existence in their surroundings. In terms of Environmental Biology, these are called <b>Biotic Factors</b>. <br> On the other hand, <b>Non-livings</b> are those,which are non-living in nature and possess opposite characteristics to living organisms. But in terms of Environmental Biology; non-living factors include; <b>water, soil, air, temperature</b> and <b>light</b>. Which all are very important and essential to life on Earth. These are called <b>Abiotic Factors</b>.
