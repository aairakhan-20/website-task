<ul>
<li><h3><u>Biosphere:</u></h3><br> The life sustaining envelope of Earth is called <b>Biosphere</b>. <br> <i>e.g. the surface of Earth on which life exists.</i></li>
<li><h3><u>Biome:</u></h3> <br> A bio-geographical region that is recognized by specific vegetation or climate is called <b>Biome.</b> <br> <i>e.g. different sub-levels on which life exists.</i></li>
<li><h3><u>Biomass:</u></h3> <br> Total mass of dry organic matter per unit area is called <b>Biomass</b>. <br></li>
<li><h3><u>Population:</u></h3> <br> A group of individuals that belong to same species living in a specific <b>habitat</b> (An area where living organisms live and maintain their lives is called as <i>Habitat.</i>) is called <b>Population.</b> <br> <i>e.g. parrots living on a same tree is their population.</i></li>
<li><h3><u>Community:</u></h3> <br> A group of different organisms or population living in a specific habitat is called <b>Community</b>. <br> <i>e.g. different birds of different species living in trees.</i></li>
<li><h3><u>Ecosystem:</u></h3> <br> The interaction of living organisms with non-living factors and energy is transferred from one level to another is called <b>Ecosystem</b>. <br> <i>e.g. our surroundings, interaction of plants & animals with water, air, soil and light, etc-.</i></li>
<li><h3><u>Pyramid of Biomass:</u></h3> <br> The total biomass of organisms at each tropic level is called <b>Pyramid of Biomass</b>. It shows that the each higher feeding level contains less biomassthan the previous tropic level. it results from energy loss in a food chain at each tropic level.</li>
<li><h3><u>Food Chain:</h3></u> <br> The transfere of food material and food energy from producers through a series of organisms i.e. producers to consumers with repeated eating and being eaten by other organisms and a chain is formed is called a <b>Food Chain</b>. <br> <i>e.g. plants --> grasshopper --> sparrow --> owl --> and so on...</i></li>
<li><h3><u>Food Web</u></h3> <br> When various food chains are linked together interect with eachother to form a complete network is called <b>Food Web</b>. <br> <i>e.g. grain to grass...{forms a food chain}, grain to mouse...{forms another food chain}</i></li>
