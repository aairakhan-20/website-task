<h3><center><mark>Abiotic components of ecosystem:</mark></center></h3>
<p>Abiotic components are the physical aspects or non-living factors of the surroundings, which may influence on the biotic components. They may control their distribution, reproduction, feeding, growth and metabolism. <br> The main abiotic components are:</p>
<ul>
<li><h5>Light:</h5> It is the most vital factor of surrounding without which life cannot exists. It is the source of energy for every ecosystem. light is very necessary for plants for photosynthesis. Besides this, light is essential for vision and for starting certain chemical processes. Also sunlight is important for human beings as they can get the benefit of Vitamin D, as sunlight helps the body to make Vitamin D which helps the calcium to deposit in bones. </li>
<li><h5>Air:</h5> It is the gaseous envelope which surrounds the Earth. It plays vital role in smooth running of ecosystem. Air is the mixture of gases which contains <b>O, N, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O (water vapours) </b> and some other elements in gaseous form which are utilized by living organisms. <b>Humidity</b> is the quantity of moisture or vapours in atmosphere, which controls transpiration in plants. living organisms inhale <b>O<sub>2</sub></b> gas, which is very mandatory for their survival. Meanwhile, plants inhale CO<sub>2</sub> gas for their photosynthesis in day time and O<sub>2</sub> in night time for respiration.</li>
<li><h5>Water:</h5> All living organisms required water for their existence. It is a major part of protoplasm in living beings. It is a raw material for both plants and animals for photosynthesis and metabolism respectively. It also acts as a universal solvent in which most of solutes dissolve easily. Water is naturally occuring on Earth and amount of water is controlled by snowfall and rain. Rivers, streams, ponds and lakes are sources of fresh water which are mostly form with rain water. While, oceans and seas are rich in salty water. Our planet Earth consists of 70% water occurance and 30% land. Within which 3% is fresh of rivers and etc-, and 97% is salty of oceans.</li>
<li><h5>Soil:</h5> The uppermost layer of the Earth's crust which consists of particles and varing size and decomposed organic material by micro-organisms is called <b>soil</b>. The decomposed and dead plants and animals are called <b>humus</b>, which enriches the soil and increases it's water and air holding capacity. Plants are anchored in soil and depend on it, as they take minerals and inorganic substances from the soil for their growth. Many natural resources are buried in soil which are takenout by man and are used for welfare of mankind. The type of soil and it's fertility determines the flora hence fauna of an ecosystem.</li>
<li><h5>Temperature:</h5> It is an important abiotic factor. It is low at high altitudes and latitudes, accordingly, high at low altitudes and latitudes. The flora and fauna changes accordingly. Temperature varies at day and night time, and changes from season to season. Mostly birds and some mammals make migration and hibernation in winter season due to extreme cold temperature. Activity of enzymes (biocatalysts in living organisms) depends upon temperature and altered with the changes in temperature. Enzymes work at the temperature 37 degree celcius along with optimal pH. Most forms of life cannot survive at extreme temperatures.</li>

<h3><center><mark>Biotic components of ecosystem:</mark></center></h3>
<p>Biotic components are the livings organisms, which interact in an ecosystem. <br> The biotic components of ecosystem are:</p>
<ol type='a'>
<li><h5>Producers:</h5> These are the organisns which can store energy and can make their food by themselves and indirectly for other organisms are termed as <b>Producers</b>. They are primary source of energy for other living organisms, and all other organisms depend directly or indirectly upon producers for food and energy. <br> <i>e.g. plants, photosynthetic bacteria and green algae [etc-].</i></li>
<li><h5>Consumers:</h5> All the other organisms that cannot make their own food by themselves, and directly or indirectly feed on the producers and get energy from them are called <b>Consumers</b>. <br> On the basis of feeding (tropic) levels, mainly, consumers are futher divided into three types;
<p><ol type='i'>
<li><b><u>PRIMARY CONSUMERS:</u></b> Organisms that directly feed on the 'producers'. These are herbivores. <br> <i>e.g. grasshopper {eats plants and leaves}, caterpillar {eats plants and leaves}, [etc-] (Goats and sheeps [etc-] and other all herbivores are producers.)</i></li>
<li><b><u>SECONDARY CONSUMERS:</u></b> Organisms that directly feed on the 'primary consumers'. These are carnivores. <br> <i>e.g. sparrow {eats grasshopper}, frog {eats catepillar}, [etc-] (lions and other carnivores are also secondary consumers as they eat goat, sheeps and other herbivores. And human beings are also secondary consumers.)</i></li>
<li><b><u>TERTIARY CONSUMERS:</u></b> Organisms that directly feed on the 'secondary consumers'. These are also carnivores. <br> <i>e.g. eagle {eats sparrow and other small birds}, anaconda {eats frog}, [etc-] (lions and [etc-] are also tertiary consumer as they eat humans and other animals.)</i></li>
</li>
</ol></p>
<li><h5>Decomposers:</h5> The micro-organisms that breakdown the dead organic matter or complex food molecules (buried inside the soil) are known as <b>Decomposers</b>. They recycle the nutrients and minerals and return it back to soil as inorganic molecules. <br> <i>e.g. micro-organisms, bacteria and fungi.</i></li>
